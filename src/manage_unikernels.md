# Managing unikernels

On the dashbaord, or after a succesful unikernel deployment, the user can see the list of all their running unikernels.

## Action Buttons
Located in the top-right corner are three control buttons for managing the unikernel's lifecycle:
*   **Restart:** To reboot the unikernel.
*   **Update:** To check for and apply newer builds of the unikernel from [our reproducible builds platform](https://builds.robur.coop).
*   **Destroy:** To terminate and remove the unikernel instance.

## Console Output
The right column features a scrollable display of the live standard output (logs) from the running unikernel.
