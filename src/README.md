Mollymawk here, is a web interface for remotely managing albatross. Mollymawk provides an easy web interface to manage a fleet of unikernels, which maybe deployed over multiple albatross servers.

Both as an interactive user interface to point and click deploying and destroying unikernels, as well as a REST API with authentication.
